## About the Project
This is part of a full-stack marketplace project. Go Language was used to build the application, using Gin as the HTTP web framework and GORM as the ORM library. Postgres is the DB of choice for this project. React and Redux were used to create the frontend.

This product replicates the Shopee Indonesia Marketplace website (www.shopee.co.id), focusing more on the marketplace functionality from user registration, purchase of products, and payment process. The marketplace system also covers several functionalities from the seller and system admin to complete the end-to-end process of the marketplace.

A group of 6 people was involved in making the project, with the distribution of 4 frontend and 2 backend. Jira was used among the groups for ticketing distribution, Agile software development methodology was adapted throughout the whole process of the project.
